# The tests run here, before the binary is built, so a red suite fails the
# image rather than shipping. That is the whole reason this is a multi-stage
# build and not a `COPY` of something built on a laptop: the artifact and the
# evidence for it come out of the same command.
#
# No protoc and no buf. Code generation happens at development time (see
# buf.gen.yaml) and the generated Rust is checked in, so the image build needs
# a Rust toolchain and nothing else.

# a Dockerfile HEALTHCHECK, because there is no shell here to run one with.

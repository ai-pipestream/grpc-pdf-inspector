# The tests run here, before the binary is built, so a red suite fails the
# image rather than shipping. That is the whole reason this is a multi-stage
# build and not a `COPY` of something built on a laptop: the artifact and the
# evidence for it come out of the same command.
#
# No protoc and no buf. Code generation happens at development time (see
# buf.gen.yaml) and the generated Rust is checked in, so the image build needs
# a Rust toolchain and nothing else.

# Docker Hardened Images debian-base: glibc and libgcc, no package manager,
# pulls from the docker.io ecosystem (dhi.io) with signed provenance, and
# runs as uid 65532 out of the box. There is no hot path that needs a shell,
# and this service never writes to disk, so the container can and should run
# with `--read-only`.

# Health checking is the orchestrator's job over gRPC
# (`grpc.health.v1.Health/Check`, which this server registers) rather than a
# Dockerfile HEALTHCHECK, because there is no shell here to run one with.
